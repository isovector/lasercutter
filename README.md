## Overview

`lasercutter` is a high-powered, high-speed, and high-tech tree parser for
Haskell. It's somewhere between 500x and 1000x faster than `scalpel` on
benchmarks and real workloads.

Not only is it smokin' fast, `lasercutter` is a general tool for chopping up any
sort of tree you've got --- not just HTML!

Best of all, `lasercutter` rips through trees in a single pass. This is truly
space-age stuff!

shout-outs to him for turning my vague ideas into reality.
